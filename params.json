{"name":"Viper","tagline":"Viper Package Index","body":"#Viper Package Index\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nestorsalceda/viper.png)](https://travis-ci.org/nestorsalceda/viper)\r\n\r\nViper is a [Python Package Index](http://pypi.python.org) implementation.\r\nDesigned for being ran in your own network, behind your firewall.\r\n\r\n##Features\r\n\r\n* Upload non-public Python eggs\r\n* Smart and transparent cache. Ask for packages to Viper, and it will cache them without\r\n  blocking new requests.\r\n* Blazing fast. Get faster results from your Continuous Integration. Deploy your\r\n  product faster.\r\n* Scale up replicating with MongoDB.\r\n* Fault tolerance. Sincerely, I'm so tired of downtimes. Avoid work paralysis when\r\n  third party infrastructure is down.\r\n\r\n##How can I use it?\r\n\r\nDeploy it. It's a simple [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org) application.\r\n\r\nAnd then, use http://yourhost/distutils\r\n\r\n* `easy_install --index-url http://yourhost/distutils package`\r\n* `pip install --index-url http://yourhost/distutils package`\r\n* `python setup.py register ...`\r\n\r\n\r\n##How it works?\r\n\r\nWhen a package request comes to viper, it tries to serve by itself, but if it's\r\nnot cached, you will be redirected to official pypi (or mirrors if you\r\nconfigured that setting).\r\n\r\nThen next time, viper will server by itself the package requested.\r\n\r\n##Demo\r\n\r\nTry the [demo](http://viper-pypi.herokuapp.com) running in heroku infrastructure.\r\n\r\n##Contribute\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to contribute, fork [repository](http://github.com/nestorsalceda/viper), and send a pull request.\r\n","google":"UA-40608249-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
