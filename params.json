{"name":"Viper","tagline":"Viper Package Index","body":".. image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/nestorsalceda/viper.png\r\n\r\nViper Package Index\r\n===================\r\n\r\nViper is a `Python Package Index <http://pypi.python.org>`_ implementation.\r\n\r\nWhat makes Viper different?\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nViper is designed for running behind a firewall, in your own network.  This\r\nallows you to share non-public packages with other members in your team.\r\n\r\nViper is designed to be blazing fast.  Running behind your firewall, you can\r\ninstall it near to your Continuous Integration (or Continuous Delivery) server\r\nand feel how you get feedback faster.  And as it has replication support using\r\nMongoDB, you can have your own mirrors in minutes.\r\n\r\nI'm still cooking a cache for keeping packages you use more, but I'm pretty\r\nsure I will finish it soon.  This means fault tolerance (sometimes PyPI or\r\nother services are down) and of course faster downloads.\r\n\r\nAnd finally simplicity.  Viper should be easy to deploy, and easy to configure\r\n(also in the client), you should start using it:\r\n\r\n::\r\n\r\n$ easy_install --index-url http://yourhost/distutils package\r\n\r\nIf the package doesn't exist in the index, it redirects automatically to PyPI\r\n(or other mirrors).\r\n","google":"UA-40608249-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
